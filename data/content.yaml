Profile:
   I recieved my B.S. from the University of California Santa Cruz in 2012.
   I started a M.S. program Computer Networking before switching to a PhD program in Systems; finally leaving with my M.S. back in Computer Networks in 2016.
   I worked in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309163511/https://www.crss.ucsc.edu/index.html">Center for Research in Storage Systems (CRSS)</a> under <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-e&q=ucsc+ethan+miller">Dr. Miller</a> and the Working Applied Group on Security and Privacy (WASP) under <a href="http://darrell.soe.ucsc.edu/">Dr. Long</a>.
   I helped develop a <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ssrc/gferasure/src/master/">C++ high performance Galois field arthemetic library</a> for Erasure Codes while working under Dr. Miller.
   My M.S. thesis advisors in Computer Networking were <a href="https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~brad/">Dr. Smith</a> and <a href="https://campusdirectory.ucsc.edu/cd_detail?uid=obraczka">Dr. Obraczka</a>.
   As an undergraduate I founded <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210621123453/https://ssc.soe.ucsc.edu/">Security Santa Cruz</a> in 2009, as of 2021 it is now <a href="https://slugsec.ucsc.edu/">Slug Security</a>.
